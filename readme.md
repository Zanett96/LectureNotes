# Lecture Notes

This repository contains some of the notes I took during my master's in computer engineering. The notes are written in Latex and are a good way to start
approaching those topics as they gets explained in University. Currently, there are notes available regarding:
1. *Machine Learning*;
2. *Neural Network and Deep Learning*.

**Disclaimer**: those notes are made for personal use and therefore **can't** be sold to anybody or used as third party material. 
Images used on those notes are based on contents found on internet for explaining some concepts presented during the course. If there is something that is ilegible to be used, just let me know and I will provide with the removal.
